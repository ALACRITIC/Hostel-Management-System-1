This is a project that I develop for presentation purposes. Code in this software is not for production ready. Images of the owner's company is deleted for safety reasons. I was the sole developer for this project and they gave me 3 months to finish everything from planning to development while I was studying in my college. Code may contain multiple bugs that I was not able to detect earlier and this project is currently not maintained at all from the time it was completed for presentation. 
Feel free to update the project if you want, I'll be happy to accept anyone's pull request that will improve the overall system. I may have skipped some safety procedure to finish by the deadline.
